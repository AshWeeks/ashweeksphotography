            <h2>Who's the Photographer?</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content-intro">
            <p>Hi. I'm Ash! I'm a 21 year old photography enthusiast who has been taking photos since the age of 13 when I got my first camera. I enjoy combining my love of photography and horses to create stunning portraits that leave everyone happy. When I'm not taking photos, I am out with my Dad - who is also a photography enthusiast and he is the reason I got into photography - taking landscape photos and also going into the local cities to do some street and documentary photography.</p>
            <p>My goal is to create stunning imagery that you will be satisfied putting up in your home.</p>
            <p>When I'm not photographing, you'll find me being creative in some other sort of way and also studying to either go into biomedicine or programming. Don't get me wrong though, horses are my one true love and I will make it my career one day.</p>
            <p>Well, that's me. Looking forward to seeing you at any shoots!</p>
